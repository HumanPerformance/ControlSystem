# Create RFComm Ports
#   This function creates radio-frquency (bluetooth) communication ports for specific devices, using their corresponding address

# Port Bind
#   This function binds the specified bluetooth device to a rfcomm port
#   Input   ::  {string} port type, {int} port number, {string} bluetooth address of device
#   Output  ::  None -- Terminal messages

# Port Release
#   This function releases the specified communication port (serial) given the type and the number
#   Input   ::  {string} "portType", {int} "portNumber"
#   Output  ::  None -- Terminal messages

# Connect to paired device
#   Connects to the bluetooth devices specified by the scenario configuration file
#   Input   ::  {array/list} "deviceName", "deviceBTAddress"
#   Output  ::  {array/list} "btObjects"
