# IMPLEMENTATION
All AMDs and SMs operate through commands generated by python scripts and functions local to the Control System
Each AMD and SM has a dedicated directory with device-specific commands and functions.
The following links will guide you directly to the device-specific sub-directory and instructions for implementation.

* Smart Handle (for Otoscope/Ophthalmoscope)
* Smart Holder (for AMDs)
* Control System
* Augmented Video Scopes (Otoscope/Ophthalmoscope)
* [Augmented Stethoscope](https://github.com/pd3d/ControlSystem/tree/stethoscope/Software/Python2.7/stethoscope)
* Augmented Blood Pressure Cuff
* Augmented Device Tracking System
* Augmented Thermometer
* Augmented Pulse Oximeter

> **NOTE:** Original python control scripts and functions were built on Python 2.7. Support for Python 3.0 is on the development pipeline
