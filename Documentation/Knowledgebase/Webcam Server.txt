# Requirements:
# 1 - Raspberry Pi
# 2 - USB Webcam


# Process:
# 01 - Always update and upgrade Raspbian
> sudo rpi-update
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

# 02 - Install "motion"
> sudo apt-get install motion

# 03 - Install additional libraries
> sudo apt-get install libav-tools

# 04 - Configure "motion" by openning the configuration file;
> sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf

# 05 - Within the configuration file, first change the text;
> "daemon off" to "daemon on"
Note: This could already be configure to "on" depending on the version of raspbian or raspberry pi

# 06 - Also change the text;
> "stream_localhost on" to "stream_localhost off"

# 07 - Also change the text;
> "webcam_maxrate 1" to "webcam_maxrate 100", or just increase it to a desirable rate

# 08 - Also change the text;
> "webcontrol_localhost on" to "off"

# 09 - Also change the text;
> "output_pictures on" to "output_pictures first"

# 10 - Also change the text;
> "ffmpeg_output_movies on" to "ffmpeg_output_movies off" 

# 11 - Also change "width" and "height" of the image to the desired size
> width 640
> height 480
Note: These are good dimensions to try first. Just keep in mind the maximum allowed by the camera itself!

# 12 - Also change the "framerate", keeping in mind the maximum set in step #6
> framerate 100

# 13 - Now exit and save changes

# 14 - Setup the "daemon" from the terminal by calling;
> sudo nano /etc/default/motion

# 15 - Within the configuration file, change the text;
> "start_motion_daemon=no" to "start_motion_daemon=yes"

# 16 - Now exit and save changes

# 17 - Ensure that the camera is connected

# 18 - Start motion from the terminal, by executing;
> sudo service motion start
