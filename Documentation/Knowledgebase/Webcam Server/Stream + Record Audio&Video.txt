Stream & Record Audio/Video:

1) Using the terminal, type the following:
$ curl http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/lrkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -

2) Edit the sources list and add the folloing line as follows:
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
$ deb http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/raspbian/ jessie main
Save and exit

3) Perform a packages update and upgrade then install the following packages:
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-raspicam uv4l-raspicam-extras uv4l-server uv4l-uvc uv4l-xscreen uv4l-mjpegstream uv4l-dummy uv4l-raspidisp uv4l-webrtc uv4l-xmpp-bridge

4) Wait for the packages to be installed. After that is over we need to enable secure HTTPS. To do so type the following in the terminal:
$ sudo bash -c "openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/selfsign.key 2048 && openssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/ssl/private/selfsign.key -out /etc/ssl/private/selfsign.crt -sha256"
	- Country Name: US
	- State: FL
	- Locality: Orlando
	- Organization: IST
	- Unit Name: PD3D
	- Common Name: .
	- Email: .

5) After the certificates have been generated, modify the uv4l-uvc.conf and uv4l-raspicam.conf files to grab the certificates upon service start:

$ sudo nano /etc/uv4l/uv4l-uvc.conf

Uncomment the following lines and modify:
server-option = --use-ssl=yes
server-option = --ssl-private-key-file=/etc/ssl/private/selfsign.key
server-option = --ssl-certificate-file=/etc/ssl/private/selfsign.crt
server-option = --www-port=443
server-option = --www-use-ssl=yes
server-option = --www-ssl-private-key-file=/etc/ssl/private/selfsign.key
server-option = --www-ssl-certificate-file=/etc/ssl/private/selfsign.crt

(Do that for both configuration files.)
(NOTE: For the uv4l-raspicam.conf, leave the "server-option = --www-port=443" option commented. DO NOT CHANGE!)

6) The system loads the default sound card at boot. To use the webcam drivers instead do the following procedure:
	- Check to see what order the cards have been loaded in
	$ cat /proc/asound/modules
 		0 snd_bcm2835			<--- Output
 		1 snd_usb_audio			<--- Output

 	- To reorder the the loading of the cards, create a file named alsa-base.conf
 	$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf

 	- Add the following lines:

 	# This sets the index value of the cards but doesn't reorder.
	options snd_usb_audio index=0
	options snd_bcm2835 index=1

	# Does the reordering.
	options snd slots=snd_usb_audio,snd_bcm2835

	- Reboot the device for the changes to take effect. After reboot is complete check again on the order that the cards have been loaded in. You should see the following:
	$ cat /proc/asound/modules
 		1 snd_usb_audio			<--- Output
 		2 snd_bcm2835			<--- Output

 7) The uv4l service should launch at boot without the need for user intervention.
 8) Navigate to https://rpiAddress:8090, where rpiAddress is the IP address of the RPi
 9) Use Firefox (recommended) or Chrome
 10) You might be warned that the website is not secure. Ignore (trust me!) and navigate to the website anyway.
 11) Choose the "Two-way Audio/Video" and scroll all the way down. Click "Call!" and enojy.

 NOTE: In case the service is not loaded, simply unplug and re-plug the webcam for the service to load (it loads/unloads automatically)
