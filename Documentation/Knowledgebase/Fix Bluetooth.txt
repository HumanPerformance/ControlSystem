# 01 - Reboot the system first
> sudo reboot

# 02 - If that does not work, re-install the "system mods" libraries
> sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-sys-mods
Note: Depending on the version of the distribution, these may have been already installed

# 03 - Then, re-install the bluetooth libraries
> sudo apt-get --reinstall install pi-bluetooth
Note: The bluetooth icon may become active immediately after this step, but I would recommend following all the steps

# 04 - Hard reboot on the system;
> sudo shutdown -r now
Note: If this does not work, repeat the process but use the "reinstall" tool for the "system mods"
