# AUGMENTED MEDICAL DEVICES
Augmented Medical Devices (AMDs) conserve the look, feel, and basic functionality of standard medical devices (e.g. opthalmoscopes, otoscopes, stethoscopes), while featuring augmented-reality techniques to enhance training, evaluation, and diagnosis. Within the context of AMDs, augmented reality techniques revolve around signal synchronization and blending, mixing, or overlaying.

# Control System
The Control System (CS) module consists of a micro-computer/controller equipped with WiFi and Bluetooth antennas, and Ethernet and USB ports for the <b> relay and collection of data </b> to/from a Control Room (CR) and other AMDs.

## Family of Augmented Medical Devices
More than a suite of devices, our team has developed an ecosystem of nine (9) AMDs, smart modules, and control systems, including:
* Smart Handle (for Otoscope/Ophthalmoscope)
* Smart Holder (for AMDs)
* Control System
* Augmented Video Scopes (Otoscope/Ophthalmoscope)
* [Augmented Stethoscope](https://github.com/pd3d/ControlSystem/tree/master/Software/Python2.7/stethoscope)
* Augmented Blood Pressure Cuff
* Augmented Device Tracking System
* Augmented Thermometer
* Augmented Pulse Oximeter
